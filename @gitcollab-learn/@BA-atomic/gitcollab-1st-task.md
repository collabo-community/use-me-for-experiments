# @BA-atomic's markdown tutorial

Hi, I'm @BA-atomic. I'm currently learning to collaborate with Git and GitHub. I'm currently learning to do so at @collabo-community. In the next section below, I will show you how to use (some) GitHub markdown.

#

Unordered list used for listing markdown examples below:
- Link: [This link text will take you to Collabo Community's Github Page when you click on it!](https://github.com/collabo-community)
- Inline Code Block: `This code block text will show up inline`.
- Bold text: **This text will show up as a Bold Text**
- Code Block:
````
This code block text will show up as a separate block
````
- Quote:
> This text will show up as a quote

There are more markdown examples, but I hope you enjoyed my little tutorial on GitHub markdown. Improvement suggestions welcome!
